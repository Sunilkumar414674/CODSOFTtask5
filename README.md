# CODSOFTtask5 :  To Build a machine learning model of credit card dataset.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

To Preprocess and normalize the fraudulent credit card transactions dataset into training ,testing Train a classification algorithm  and to Evaluate the model's performance using metrics.

# OBJECTIVE:

 To Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions data set.

# LIBRARIES USED:

 1. pandas is used data structures like DataFrame and Series, which allow for easy manipulation, analysis, and cleaning of structured data.

 2. sklearn is useful for data mining and data analysis, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

 3. matplotlib is useful for a wide range of plotting capabilities, from basic line plots to complex 3D plots.

 4. seaborn is useful for high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

# STEPS INVOLVED:

 1. Load and preprocess the data.
    
 2. Handle class imbalance.
 
 3. Split the data into training and testing sets.

 4. Train a classification algorithm.

 5. Evaluate the model.
